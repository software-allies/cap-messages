# CAP MESSAGES

This is a real time messages module using **Ionic**, **Socket.io** and **Loopback**.
This module is divided in two main codes, which are the main code of the module which contains the UI and a service that uses connections with Loopback and Socket.io. And the other part that is the Loopback code which is in the Back-End part, this code is available on the following url: https://github.com/VictorAlonsoCM/loopback-for-CAP

**Note**: Please use the branch *feature/reconfiguration-loopback-local-storage*, because this is still in development and the code have received significant changes since I accepted to develop this module, like a significant decrease in the complexity of the algorithm.

## Features:
- [ ] Authentication service.
- [x] General messages in real time.
- [x] List of users connected.
- [x] Private messages in real time.

At this moment this is still in development.
